This weekend I updated the Tiny Tiny RSS on my VPS and changed to the self-hosted mercury service. 

I read several articles on Hong Kong and very impressed, especially Reverend Chu Yiu-ming quoted to Howard Zinn

>Civil disobedience is not our problem. Our problem is civil obedience. Our problem is that people all over the world have obeyed the dictates of leaders…and millions have been killed because of this obedience…Our problem is that people are obedient allover the world in the face of poverty and starvation and stupidity, and war, and cruelty. Our problem is that people are obedient while the jails are full of petty thieves… (and) the grand thieves are running the country. That’s our problem.

Hong Kong seemed a fantasy land when I was a child. Watching movie _Youth and Danger_, I thought it is a wild city enjoy lawless freedom. I was moved by the unification ceremony that it eventually come back to China. But now, Hong Kong is "chinafied".
