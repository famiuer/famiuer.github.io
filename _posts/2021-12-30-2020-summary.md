# 2022 Summary

## Harvest
This year, I gained numerous valuable professional development lessons in practice and the opportunity to pursue my PhD.


In terms of work, I successfully completed the entire project process as a project manager in the first half of the year, from acquisition to execution to delivery. During this process, I was fortunate to have my colleagues' support, assistance and supervision. My team's work schedule and timelines were smooth despite the Shanghai lockdown, and we completed the deliverables on time. This was an extraordinary endeavour. 

On the technical side, I also learned a lot of new information and knowledge, improved my understanding of metocean conditions for offshore wind development, and better understood how to apply industry standards in reality. During the project's execution, I focused on Extreme Value Analysis, turbulence, lightning, and marine growth, some of which are new to me. I found they are exciting. Learning and practising how to communicate with clients and teams on the job was also highly beneficial.

I also successfully applied for a PhD programme at Aura CDT in the UK. These years of work experience have significantly assisted my application. I'm also thankful for the opportunities and training I've received from my ex-employer.

I relocated to the United Kingdom in August to begin my PhD studies. It was a completely new cultural experience, and I decided to fully use this fantastic opportunity.

I noticed a strong emphasis on teamwork, presentation, and time management throughout the course. It is difficult for one person to work alone in the academic field, and he or she must communicate with other researchers. Presentation is an important skill to develop to increase one's influence and the impact of one's research. Time management has enabled me to better organise my time, prioritise tasks, and reject inefficient ones, allowing me to focus on long-term development.


## 2023 Plans
Looking back on the year, I have some regrets that I plan to avoid repeating in the coming year. In the coming year, I plan to accomplish the following objectives.

 * Read twenty books. I intend to read a few more books to broaden my knowledge.
 * Exercise for 8 hours per week. I prepare my body for good health by relaxing both my mind and body.
 * Take part in open-source projects. I want to learn more about the workflow of open-source projects and contribute to the community.
 * Six website articles, one every two months on average. I hope to write more articles and share my experiences and ideas.
 * Interact with people on LinkedIn and make sure there are weekly comments and interactions. I want to interact with more people online and build my personal brand.

Overall, I plan to work harder in the coming year to broaden my horizons, interact with more people and increase my knowledge.
