Recently I found a great open-source tool/library _[DHI Tools](https://github.com/robjameswall/dhitools)_ to process the DHI MIKE 21 data file. It contains great Jupyter notebooks as examples. The experience is great and free of charge. It should be known by more engineers who use those software and improve their working flow.

The great tool maybe a little demanding on python and github knowledge, The readme could be more specific and instructive.
