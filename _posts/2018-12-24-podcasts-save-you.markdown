In my sophomore year of college, I got an iPod Shuffle and happened to open the podcast page in iTunes. I didn't know what "podcast" mean but I finally downloaded several episodes and listened to them. Not very impressed. I just leave them alone.

At 2013, Zhihu, a copycat of Quora, was still a  not well-recognized but pretty friendly online community. On it, I saw the [IT公论](https://itgonglun.com/) (IT Public Discussion) and began my journey of podcasts. I listened to the IPN podcasts and subscribed to more podcasts.

A long time passed, I can't remember how much time I have spent on podcasts. It's really fun. I highly recommend the [Pocket Casts](https://www.pocketcasts.com/) or [Castro](http://supertop.co/castro/). These are great apps and give you more freedom compared with the traditional platform as Chinese Lizhi or Ximalaya.

I recommend following podcasts. 

  * [The Civil Engineering Podcast](https://engineeringmanagementinstitute.org/cep-podcast/)

  * [SINICA](https://supchina.com/series/sinica/) including CaiXin-Sinica Business Brief.

  * [Little Red Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/user-340830825)

  * [MERICS](https://www.merics.org/) in English.

  * [China Tech Talk](https://chinatechtalk.libsyn.com/)

  * [Word of the day](https://player.fm/series/1319408)

  Following are in Chinese.

  * [Kernal Panic](https://kernelpanic.fm/)

  * [Museelogue](https://bowuzhi.fm/)

  * [Typechat](https://thetype.com/typechat/)

  * [Culture Potato](http://www.culturepotato.com)

  * [迟早更新](http://www.weareones.com/podcast)

  * [提前怀旧](https://pretro.xyz/)

  * [路书](http://lushu88.com)

  * [得意忘形](https://www.lizhi.fm/user/2579240391643675180)

  * [天书广播](http://tianshuguangbo.com/blog/)


There are many great podcasts.
