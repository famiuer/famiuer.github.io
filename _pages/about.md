Geng Chen (Chinese, é™ˆæ›´) is currently a post-graduate student at the University of Hull.

Hi, there! I was a coastal engineer in DHI China from 2015 to 2022.  I returned to university to pursue my PhD at [Aura CDT](https://auracdt.hull.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"} in offshore wind energy and the environment.

My research and personal interests include:

* Numerical hydrodynamic and wave simulation
* Statistics, like Extreme Value Analysis
* Computer Programming
