The dev board supports 1000M Ethernet while a USB 2.0 port is not so impressive as 3.0 but enough to use. It uses micro-usb to power and 5V is typical input. 

An aluminum box and an extend card to employ a NAS. External charger with 12V 3A currents. Quite powerful to support multiple external devices like hard drives. 

External Modules to NEO2 are great: [DIY NAS Server with 1-bay NAS Dock & NEO2](http://wiki.friendlyarm.com/wiki/index.php/1-bay_NAS_Dock_v1.2_for_NanoPi_NEO/NEO2).

At first I did not know you should weld these two components together to use but thought it would work after I put two pieces together like LEGO bricks. Eventually, my friend told me the basic point. The electric soldering iron is a mysterious and very risky tool since seeing an adult smell the hot air near the iron to estimate the temp which is always a nightmare and never perishes. I nervously welded the dev board with the NAS dock after some settings, I finally got a pretty simple and strong NAS. Because of the router
